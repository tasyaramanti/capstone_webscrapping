# Web-Scrapping using Beautifulsoup

This project is a capstone project for Algoritma Academy Data Analytics Specialization. Expected deliverables from this project is to do a simple webscrapping to get information. I also use a simple flask dashboard in this project to show the result of the scrap and visualization.

### Capstone Case Choice

   (Medium) Data kurs US Dollar ke rupiah dari `https://www.exchange-rates.org/history/IDR/USD/T`
   *Data yang diperlukan: `harga harian`, dan `tanggal`
   *Membuat plot pergerakan kurs USD
   
### Summary

- exchange rate of 1 USD to IDR since January 2022 to July 2022 tend to increase
- On June a significant amount of decreament occurred
- The highest exchange rate during 2022 happens on July 2022
- We can say that IDR weakened against USD
